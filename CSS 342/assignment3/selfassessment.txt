Do you have test functions testing all your functions? Have you tested
edge cases such as first element in an array, last element in an
array, empty array, etc? 
I think I have tested for all the cases of the program. I made sure to include all the errors necessary for my program using cerr
as well. I also used different maze files to test on all different maze to make sure the program works on different mazes. 
complete and correct programs:  50 / 50


Does your program compile without warnings? Are there any blocks of
repeated code that can be simplified?
Since recursion itself helps simplifies programs I think that my program is simplified considering it has used recursion, which
is the main topic for this program. 

good programming practices:    30 / 30

Do you have comments for each class both in the header and
implementation file? Does each variable and function have an
associated comment? Is your program properly indented? See "Code Style
Examples - Snippets" under C++ Resources for some common problems. For
example, all file names have to be in lowercase, all class names are
capitalized, need to have spaces after comments, stick to maximum 80
characters per line, space between operators, etc.
I have included all the comments I thought were needed including my class descriptions, implementation descriptions, individual method
description, any necessary variable descriptions and etc. 

code that is easy to understand:    20 / 20
